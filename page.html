            <p>
                Norman Ernest Borlaug est un agronome américain, né le 25 mars 1914 à Cresco
                et mort le 12 septembre 2009 à Dallas (Texas)

                <h1> Work </h1>
                Norman Borlaug was an American agronomist known as the "Father of the Green Revolution." His work
                focused on developing high-yielding, disease-resistant wheat varieties, particularly in Mexico and later
                in South Asia,
                which significantly increased food production and helped avert widespread famine.
                <br> His work in developing countries, especially on the Indian subcontinent, is estimated to have saved
                as many as one billion people from starvation and death
                <br>Borlaug also created a wheat-rye hybrid known as triticale, and his methods were used by others to
                develop new varieties of highly productive rice. The increased yields resulting from Borlaug’s new
                strains empowered many developing countries, though their use required large amounts of chemical
                fertilizers and pesticides.
                These high-yielding crops raised concerns about cost and potentially harmful environmental effects,
                though Borlaug argued that uncontrolled population growth had necessitated such production methods.
                Although newer varieties of food grains have been developed to be high-yielding and also resistant to
                local pests and diseases, modern agriculture has yet to achieve environmental sustainability in the face
                of an ever-growing human population.
                Borlaug served as director of the Inter-American Food Crop Program (1960–63) and as director of the
                International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center, Mexico City, from 1964 to 1979. In 1986 Borlaug
                created the World Food Prize to honour individuals who have contributed to improving the availability
                and quality of food worldwide. In constant demand as a consultant, Borlaug served on numerous committees
                and advisory panels on agriculture, population control, and renewable resources. He also taught at Texas
                A&M University (1984–2009), where the Norman Borlaug Institute for International Agriculture was
                established in 2006.
                His numerous other honours include the Presidential Medal of Freedom (1977), the National Medal of
                Science (2004), the Congressional Gold Medal (2006), and the United Nations FAO Agricola Medal (2010).
